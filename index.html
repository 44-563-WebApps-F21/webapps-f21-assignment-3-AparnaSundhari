    <h1>Aparna Sundhari</h1>

    <h6>My Favorite place is Hyderabad</h6>

    <p>A major landmark of Hyderabad with four graceful <b>minarets</b> located in the old city. It was built by
        <b>Muhammed Quli Qutub Shah</b> as a memorial for plague victims. Charminar, on most occasions, is used to
        represent the city and the state and is hailed as a unique <b>Deccan</b> monument. It is in the midst of
        Charkaman which are four archways to roads leading in all four directions from the Charminar monument.Hyderbad
        is my birthplace, And I have many memories connected with hyderabad.
