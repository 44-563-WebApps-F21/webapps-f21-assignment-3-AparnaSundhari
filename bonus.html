        There is an ancient Asgardian prophecy describing the ultimate destruction of Asgard in a cataclysmic event
        known as Ragnar√∂k. According to the prophecy, the end of Asgard was to begin with the Fire Demon Surtur,
        empowered by his Eternal Flame with white color, raining destruction down on the Asgardian home world, consuming
        it in flames.
